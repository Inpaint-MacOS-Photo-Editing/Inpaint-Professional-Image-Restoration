## What is Inpaint?

![Inpaint Example](https://static.filehorse.com/screenshots-mac//photo-and-design/inpaint-screenshot-01.png)

Inpaint is a professional-grade application that uses artificial intelligence to remove unwanted objects and defects from images. It analyzes the surrounding pixels and reconstructs the background automatically, producing clean and realistic results. The tool is ideal for both amateur and professional use, offering high precision without requiring manual editing skills.

With support for batch processing, users can enhance multiple photos at once, saving time on repetitive tasks. The software works with JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, and other popular formats. Its intuitive brush and marker tools make it easy to select areas for removal, and the preview function allows for instant verification before saving.

Inpaint is built for performance and stability on modern systems, including macOS. It leverages GPU acceleration on compatible hardware to speed up processing, especially with high-resolution images. Whether you're retouching portraits, cleaning up landscapes, or preparing images for print, Inpaint delivers consistent quality.
